# Synthesia

Synesthesia Engine - Audio-to-Visual Hallucination System A real-time generative AI system that transforms sound into flowing abstract visual patterns. Experience synesthesia through machine learning - watch as music, speech, and ambient noise create unique, ever-evolving visual landscapes.

## What it does

Captures live audio (microphone or system audio) and extracts rich acoustic features
Maps sound characteristics to a neural network's latent space
Generates abstract, flowing visuals that respond to rhythm, melody, timbre, and energy
Creates emergent visual behaviors with temporal memory and "hallucination modes"

## Key Features

🎵 Real-time audio analysis with advanced feature extraction (MFCCs, spectral features, tempo)
🎨 Generative visual synthesis using trained neural networks
🌊 Smooth temporal interpolation for fluid, organic motion
🧠 Multiple "personality modes" - from chaotic to meditative responses
⚡ Optimized for 30+ FPS performance on consumer GPUs

## Why This Exists ?

Exploring the intersection of audio processing, generative AI, and real-time systems. Not just a visualizer - a system that learns to "see" sound through its own learned visual language.
